# CinemaManager
My first project, a console program, where you can manage your cinema.
For now, you can make your own movies, create seances of them, and make seat reservations.
Remember to quit the program with "exit" command, so your progress will be saved!
All commands in every menu can be explained with "help" command.

In next update (first weekend of February), I plan to add another reporsitory with same program, but with GUI.
Future updates will contain export to database (prob MySQL), and webservice showing actual cinema status.
